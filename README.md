WARNING: Only use this program in single player or if you are an admin. You have been warned.


Choose the colors on the regions you would like. Use "copy to clipboard" and paste into the game console using tab. "Enter in game" will automatically activate the game window, open the console, and send the command. Be sure when using either option, you are looking at the dino for the command to work.
